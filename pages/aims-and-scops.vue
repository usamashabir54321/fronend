								<h4>Aims of Lexic Microbiology</h4>
								<p>Lexic Microbiology is an international, peer-reviewed, open-access journal that aims to provide a platform to bring together the scientists of all microbiological disciplines around the world. It is an advanced forum to publish research and review related to prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, yeasts, archaea, protozoa, viruses, and prions. The journal focuses on the importance of microbiology to address current global challenges in disciplines of medical, animal, food, environment, and agriculture and published their basic and applied studies across all these disciplines. The journal also covers the studies on interactions between beneficial as well as pathogenic microorganisms and their interactions with hosts and environments. The studies comprise molecular aspects will be given preference to gain a significant contribution of broad interest. There is no restriction on paper length and aims to publish research and review articles in detail as possible. Full experimental details along with experimental procedure must be provided to reproduce the results. Studies in the following sections of all the microbiology disciplines are included:</p>
								<ul class="c-list">
									<li>Research papers</li>
									<li>Review papers</li>
									<li>Short communications</li>
									<li>Minireview papers</li>
								</ul>
								<h6>Sections of Lexic Microbiology</h6>

								<h6>Agricultural microbiology</h6>
								<p>Agricultural microbiology is a section of Lexic Microbiology. It focusses to published any research or review articles that address beneficial and pathogenic microorganism involved in crop growth and development. It will involve the ecological or physiological interactions between microbes and plants or algae. The Editorial Board will review all manuscripts submitted for publication in this section. However, articles that seem to be outside the scope of the subject matter listed here may be referred to another section of Lexic Microbiology</p>
								<h6>Topics</h6>
								<ul class="c-list">
									<li>The microbes involved in symbiosis and endosymbiosis </li>
									<li>Diversity of rhizospheric microbes, endophytic, mycorrhizae, lichens, epiphytes, etc.</li>

									<li>Microbial pathogenesis for crop plant</li>
									<li>Microbes involved in stress tolerance</li>
									<li>Production of microbial pesticide and biofertilizer</li>
								</ul>
								<h6>Food microbiology</h6>
								<p>Food microbiology is a section of Lexic Microbiology. It focuses on different microbial communities present in foods and responsible for their spoilage, safety and/or ripening. Microbes are also directly involved in food production and bioprotection. Starter cultures are usually added to raw food matrices, producing a typical flavor and odor. Indeed, they can limit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms by substrate competition or by antimicrobic compounds. Microbial communities also produce biofilm in industrial machineries, and contaminate either raw or processed food. To better understand these problems, it is important to identify the relationships between the composition of the microbial community and the processes. Fast, simple, sensitive and specific methods are required to study each food ecosystem and to realize the parameters regulating microorganism growth and interactions. This section will remain focused on the study of microbial processes in food, microbial communities, microbial interactions, microbial detection and antimicrobial resistance.</p>
								<h6>Topics</h6>
								<ul class="c-list">
									<li>Food microbiology</li>
									<li>Pathogenic microorganisms</li>
									<li>Spoilage microorganisms</li>
									<li>Interaction in food matrices</li>
									<li>Detection (traditional and molecular methods, biosensor)</li>
									<li>Starter cultures</li>
